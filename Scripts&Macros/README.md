## Missing figure 7

I wanted to compare the results of elemental mapping (using EFTEM) with the background corrected element signal from SR-EELS (see figure 8). It was too late that I realised the measurements had been performed at different positions of the specimen. There was no time to make a new measurement before the conference starts.
