# MC2015-Poster
Scripts and macros for Fiji that were used to create the images of my MC2015 poster.

## Why I created this repository
A main goal of science is repeatability. That is why I present all my scripts and macros at this public repository. Everybody can inspect my code to review what I have done to create the content of my poster.

## Try the scripts and macros by yourself
To run the majority of the scripts and macros you only need to download [Fiji] and the recorded [images (672 MB)]. The correction of the SR-EELS data sets has been performed with [EFTEMj].
